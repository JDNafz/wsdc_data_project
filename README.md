# Everything Under Construction* 

## West Coast Swing Data

An analysis of West Coast Swing points from the World Swing Dance Council's Database. The goal of this project is to update the data and also look for trends that can be found relating to dancers competitive roles.

## Update: 4/28/23 --

> Just getting started trying to understand all of Connie's work, currently trying to separate points by lead and follow.
